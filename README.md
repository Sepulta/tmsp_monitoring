# Monitorning transitional millisecond pulsars

Transitional millisecond pulsars are a class of objects that undergo transitions between radio millisecond pulsar and accreting states. These transitions happen on a decade timescale, so although they are interesting, automated monitoring that could detect them would be valuable. Fortunately these transitions are frequently visible in the gamma rays, and the Fermi gamma-ray telescope is a sky-scanning instrument. So this package builds and maintains up-to-date light curves for the transitional millisecond pulsars based on publicly available Fermi data.



For the moment the script entry point is update.py in the root directory.



The Fermi plugin maintains a collection of all Fermi photons ever; a description of how to do this is available at https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/scitools/LAT_weekly_allsky.html .
