# Monitorning transitional millisecond pulsars

Transitional millisecond pulsars are a class of objects that undergo transitions between radio millisecond pulsar and accreting states. These transitions happen on a decade timescale, so although they are interesting, automated monitoring that could detect them would be valuable. Fortunately these transitions are frequently visible in the gamma rays, and the Fermi gamma-ray telescope is a sky-scanning instrument. So this package builds and maintains up-to-date light curves for the transitional millisecond pulsars based on publicly available Fermi data.
